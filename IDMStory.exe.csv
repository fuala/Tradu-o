There are a few things you'll need to be aware of, however, so please read this contract of agreement VERY carefully before hiring the Merchants.\r\n\r\nHired Merchant Contract\r\n1) According to the points stated below, Hired Merchants disappear after storing your items and mesos at the Store Bank.\r\n  - If the Hired Merchant works at the same spot for more than #r24 Hours#k straight, #rthe Hired Merchant's contract will expire, and the Merchant will disappear.#k\r\n  - #rIf the inventory is full#k, the Hired Merchant will be removed from its post (executes after 1st warning)\r\n2) After Hired Merchant disappears, you'll need to see #rFredrick#k, who's at the Free Market Entrance, and retrieve your items and mesos.\r\n3) You will not be able to hire Merchants until you have retrieved all of your mesos and items.\r\n4) A 1% storing fee of the total sales and original price of the item will be charged daily to the user storing the mesos and items at the Store Bank past #r24 hours#k.\r\n5) Once the storing fee exceeds 100%, the mesos and items stored will be donated to the Free Market Fund.\r\n6) GM's hold the right to change the name of the store without notice if it contains vulgar, inappropriate language.\r\n7) Players can have only one Hired Merchant set up at a time."
